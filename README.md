This is a simple blog application that I created using the Vite framework. It allows users to read articles and, after logging in, create, edit, and delete their own articles.

Installation and Usage
Download this repository to your device.
In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved the repository.
Install dependencies using the command npm install.
Run the application using the command npm run dev.
The application should now be available at http://127.0.0.1:5173.
Examples and Code Snippets
The application includes the following pages:

The homepage with a list of all articles.
The article details page, which displays the title, content, and author of the article.
The login page, which can be found in the top menu. If you do not have an account, you can create one on this page.
The page for creating a new article, which is available after logging in.
The page for editing and deleting articles, which is also available after logging in.

The application's code is written in TypeScript and uses React as a library for building the user interface.
